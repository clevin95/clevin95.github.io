  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I ran into a pretty common road block for most begginer iOS developers; I wanted to share information between a comunity of users but only knew how to save information using core data. After doing some reading I discovered that what I would need was some kind of cloud database to which I could push data and then pull back down later. Luckly I came across a great service called parse, which essentially abstracted all the complexities away from cloud based storage and turned it into a few lines of easy to read objective C code. With parse I was able to easily save oobjects to cloud and then pull them back down with simply one line query requests. Using parse I was able to create user acounts with distinct information and have users make posts that could then be view by other users remotely. While parse is great and free up untill your getting 3 requests per second (which is a ton) I didnt feal comfortable with having so much &lsquo;magic&rsquo; in my app. I decided to dig deaper to get a better understanding of what was going on behind parse.</p>

<p>After diging deaper into cloud based storage I was able to break down the procces of creating your own cloud backend into three distinct phases. The first step is to build a web app which you can hit remotely with an api. To do this you&rsquo;ll need to learn the basics of a web framework such as ruby on rails or node.js. This app will have to be set up to receive POST requests contaiing the data you would like to save and also handle GET requests which will return the information specified in the url. After you&rsquo;ve set up your app you can push it to a cloud hosting platform such as Heroku or Engine Yard. Next, you&rsquo;ll need to set up a web database. When it comes to the details of what makes certain batabases preferable to others I have very litle insight. I&rsquo;ve looked around an found a few blogs with highlight the different features of the major databases. Here is one verry good resourse I came accross:
<a href="http://kkovacs.eu/cassandra-vs-mongodb-vs-couchdb-vs-redis">http://kkovacs.eu/cassandra-vs-mongodb-vs-couchdb-vs-redis</a>
once you&rsquo;ve got your app entirely hooked up to the database your all ready to start hitting the web app&rsquo;s api from within your iOS app</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Making a slide down menu</p>

<p>This weekend I spent a lot of time playing around with core dynamics. Core dynamics is a physics engine which comes with ios7, enabling you to do things like add gravity and mass to your views. To start using uidynamics all you need to do is add a uidynamicanimator property to your view controller. You&rsquo;ll then need to aloc init the animator with the following line:
self.animator = [[UIDynamicAnimator alloc]initWithReferenceView:self.view];
In this customized initializer the reference view represents the frame which all animations will take place in relation to. Thus if the reference view were moving, all animation would move in relation. Once the animator has been alloc inited the syntax for adding forces is fairly straightforward. If you wanted to add a push force to a view for instance you would write:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>UIPushBehavior *push = [[UIPushBehavior alloc]initWithItems:@[self.moveView] mode:UIPushBehaviorModeContinuous];
</span><span class='line'>push.pushDirection = CGVectorMake(1, 0);
</span><span class='line'>[self.animator addBehavior:self.push];
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In this particular example the self.moveView would be pushed off the screen. Because the mode was set to UIPushBehaviorModeContinuous the speed of the view will increase. This is becuase a constant force results in a constant acceloration. If you wanted a constant velocity you could set the mode to UIPushBehaviorModeInstantaneous or use the following snippet:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>UIDynamicItemBehavior *velocityBehavior = [[UIDynamicItemBehavior alloc]initWithItems:@[self.menuView]];
</span><span class='line'>[velocityBehavior addLinearVelocity:velocity forItem:self.menuView];
</span><span class='line'>[self.animator addBehavior:velocityBehavior];</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After aquainting myself with the basics of uidynamic animator I set out to create a dragable drop down menu similar to the controll panel in iOS7. To begin I created a uiview to which I added a pangesturerecogniser which delegated to the method handlePan:. In my handlePan method i wrote the following</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Essentially the method works by attaching the movement of the view along the Y axis to the movement of the pan gesture. Then once the gesture has stopped the view is given an initial velocity equal to the velocity of gesture as the touch ended and a force in the same direction. It is necessary to give the view a velocity as well as a push so that the view moves in one continuous motion.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Intro to MKMapKit</p>

<p>If you have a smart phone it&rsquo;s likely that you&rsquo;ve interacted with apps which employ a map as part of their UI. While the maps are impressive and appear complicated to implement, apple has made adding maps incredibly easy by dealing with most of the functionality, such as scrolling and zooming, themselves. The first step when adding a map object to your project is to add the MapKit framework to your binary libraries. The way to do this is by going to your main project selecting the build phases tab and pressing the plus button in the Link Binary With Libraries drop down. You&rsquo;ll then want to search for MapKit.framework and add it. You&rsquo;ll now be able to import &lt;MapKit/MapKit.h> to all the view controller’s you wish to add a map.</p>

<p>The next step is to add a map view object. You can ether do this by dragging the map view object into your story board or by alloc initing it in the view did load. You now should have a scrollable and zoomable map in your view. Now that you have a map in your project you can do such things as track the user’s location and drop pins.</p>

<p>To track location you will need to import the CoreLoaction framework in the same way in which you imported MapKit. You then can track the users movement using the following code:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager <em>)manager didFailWithError:(NSError </em>)error
{
  NSLog(@&ldquo;didFailWithError: %@&rdquo;, error);
  UIAlertView *errorAlert = [[UIAlertView alloc]
                             initWithTitle:@&ldquo;Error&rdquo; message:@&ldquo;Failed to Get Your Location&rdquo; delegate:nil cancelButtonTitle:@&ldquo;OK&rdquo; otherButtonTitles:nil];
  [errorAlert show];
}</p></li>
<li><p>(void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager <em>)manager didUpdateToLocation:(CLLocation </em>)newLocation fromLocation:(CLLocation *)oldLocation
{</p></li>
</ul>


<p>}</p>

<p>Now that you have the users location tracked you’ll want to be able to drop a pin. To drop a pin at the users current location you can use the following code</p>

<p>MKPointAnnotation *point = [[MKPointAnnotation alloc] init];
point.coordinate = currentLocation.coordinate;
[self.currentLocationMap addAnnotation:point];</p>

<p>You can also remove pins by writing: 
NSMutableArray *pins = [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithArray:[self.currentLocationMap annotations]];
[self.currentLocationMap removeAnnotations:pins];</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At WWDC, 2014, apple unveiled iOS 8 and Xcode 6. For developers the big news out of the conference was apples new programming language, &ldquo;swift.&rdquo; However the new language may have overshadowed some even more groundbreaking changes introduced in the new operating system. Among the biggest changes, likely to greatly effect the way in which apps are developed and used, was apple’s introduction of &ldquo;extensibility.&rdquo; Essentially extensibility means that apps will now be able to communicate and build off of existing UI&rsquo;s. This new stance on allowing apps to build off each other takes a sharp turn from the previously used technique of &ldquo;Sandboxing.&rdquo; Sandboxing was a security measure which prevented programs from interacting by giving each app a confined area in memory and CPU. The ultimate goal of Sanboxing was to prevent untrusted third party apps from interacting with and harming the host software. This security, however, won&rsquo;t all be lost with apples introduction of extensibility. Apps still must ask for the users permission when doing such things as accessing the internet. Furthermore there still are many more restrictions put on iPhone development than there are for most other mobile operating systems, like Android.</p>

<p>One of the most obvious new capabilities introduced to developers with extensibility is the ability to create custom global keyboards. This past weekend I spent some time trying to figure out how I could make my own custom keyboard. The first few steps were very straightforwardly build into Xcode. The first thing I did was create a new target for my project (File &ndash;> New &ndash;> Target). After selecting new target I navigated to the extensions tab where I found an option for &ldquo;custom keyboard.&rdquo; Other extensions available were &ldquo;Action Extension&rdquo;, &ldquo;Document Picker&rdquo;, &ldquo;Photo Editing Extension&rdquo;, &ldquo;Share Extension&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Today Extension.&rdquo; Next I went to the .plist for my new custom keyboard, its important to note that you both your main project and new keyboard extension now have plists and it is important to select the keyboard extension’s property list. In order to access properties such as language and text alignment for your new keyboard you need to right click on the plist file and select the &ldquo;source code&rdquo; option. The plist will now be a markdown file in which you can set the settings of your keyboard.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This past week I spent a lot of time developing and perfecting an algorithm to find all english dictionary words that can be formed from a given set of letters. I started out using a simple recursive algorithm which found each permutation for a set of letters and checked them against a dictionary. This solution was slow and caused a stack overflow for sets of letters over 20. Eventually I was able to develope a permutation generating algorithm which worked allongside the dictionary look up algorithm. This more sopisitcated aproach was able to procces every letter of the alphabet times 65 (16,900 letters) in 8.5 minutes with only using a max of 500mb of live memory. I’ve outlined my process in detail bellow.</p>

<p>My first function focussed entirely on generating permutations and checking each permutation against the dictionary:
//function returns an array of words that can be created using the letters inputed to &ldquo;letters to add&rdquo;
//newWord and newWordList both start out empty when you call the function</p>

<p>func allPermutations(lettersToAdd:Character[], newWord:Character[], inout newWordList:String[]) &ndash;> String[] {</p>

<pre><code>var lettersCopy = lettersToAdd
var newWordCopy = newWord
let newWordString:String = convertToString(newWord)
if (self.isRealWord(newWordString)) {
    newWordList.append(newWordString)
}
for i in 0..lettersCopy.count{
    var addLetter = lettersCopy[i]
    lettersCopy.removeAtIndex(i)
    newWordCopy.append(addLetter)
    allPermutations(lettersCopy, newWord: newWordCopy, newWordList: &amp;newWordList)
    lettersCopy = lettersToAdd
    newWordCopy = newWord
}
return newWordList
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>The function works by removing each letter from the lettersToAdd array and adding it to the newWord array and running the function recursively on each one of these newWords and reduced sets of lettersToAdd. This is demonstrated best by a simple depiction of the recursive tree. In this image the arrays on the left are the &ldquo;lettersToAdd&rdquo;, and the arrays on the right are the &ldquo;newWord&rdquo; arrays. As you can see the new words contain all the possible combinations of abc and each subset.</p>

<pre><code>                               [a,      b,      c] []
                              /         |          \
                           /            |            \
                         /              |               \
                      /                 |                 \
                [b, c] [a]          [a, c] [b]             [a,b] [c]
                /   |                   /\                     |   \
              /     |                  /  \                    |     \
            /       |                 /    \                   |       \
          /         |                /      \                  |         \
        /           |               /        \                 |           \
      /             |              /          \                |             \
</code></pre>

<p>[c] [a, b]          [b] [a, c]   [c] [b, a]      [a] [b, c]   [b] [c,a]       [a] [c,b]</p>

<pre><code>|                   |             |               |            |                |
</code></pre>

<p>[] [a,b,c]          [] [a,c,b]   [] [b,a,c]     [] [b, c, a]  [] [c,a,b]       [] [c,b,a]</p>

<p>This algorithm is nice because it is straight forward and doesn&rsquo;t create any duplicates (if there is only one of each letter). However it is also incredibly slow for long sets of letters. The run time is N! + (N &ndash; 1)! + (N &ndash; 2)! + &hellip; (N &ndash; N)!) * logbase2(lengthOfDictionary). You have to multiply by log2(lengthOfDictionary) because there is a dictionary look up for every new word.</p>

<p>My first attempt to make this algorithm faster lead me down an incorrect path. Because I wanted to find the longest word that could be formed from a given set of letters I concluded that a solution that built from the top down as apposed to the button up would be more efficient. So instead of adding letters to newWord array I created an algorithm which was based on swapping letters. This algorithm is effective in creating all permutations of a set of letters without duplicates but does not find subset permutations. It also takes the same number of steps to create the full length permutations as my first algorithm so effectively it doesn&rsquo;t really build solutions from the top down as I had hoped.</p>

<p>//Solution by swapping
//Failed attempt at making algorithm faster</p>

<p>&ndash;(NSString <em>)largestRealWord:(NSMutableArray </em>)lettersToAdd</p>

<pre><code>               withCount:(NSInteger)count {
NSMutableArray *allSwapsForCount = [self allEllemensIn:lettersToAdd moveToIndex:count];
if (count == [lettersToAdd count] + 1){
    NSString *arrayAsString = [self convertArrayToString:lettersToAdd];
    if ([self isDictionaryWord:arrayAsString]){
        NSLog(@"%@",arrayAsString);
        return arrayAsString;
    }else{
        return nil;
    }
}
for (NSMutableArray *newSwap in allSwapsForCount){
    [self largestRealWord:newSwap withCount:count + 1];
}
return nil;
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>&ndash;(NSMutableArray <em>)allEllemensIn:(NSMutableArray </em>)letterArray</p>

<pre><code>                 moveToIndex:(NSInteger)index {
NSMutableArray *outputArray = [[NSMutableArray alloc]init];
for (NSInteger i = index + 1; i &lt; [letterArray count]; i++){
    NSMutableArray *newCombination = [letterArray mutableCopy];
    [newCombination exchangeObjectAtIndex:index withObjectAtIndex:i];
    [outputArray addObject:newCombination];

[outputArray addObject:letterArray];
return outputArray;

<p>THE VERY LONG BUT VERY FAST SOLUTION:</p>

<h6>#</h6>

<p>After attempting to make my first algorithm more efficient I realized that there was probably no significantly faster way to create all permutations for a given set of letters. However I also had the realization that I was not trying to create all permutations, I was trying to create all permutations that were dictionary words. This important distinction lead me to the realization that instead of having the dictionary look up process and the permutation generation algorithm work independent of each other I should have each process inform the other. I eventually realized that if I looked up the permutations being created in the newWord arrays in the dictionary and couldn’t find any words starting with the combination I would be able to stop recursing down that branch. If I did find a word starting with the generated sequence using binary search I could then use the range in which this sequence was found to narrow down the section of the dictionary that needed to be searched for each newly generated word down the respective path. Thus as the newWord array gets longer the range of the dictionary that needs to be searched gets smaller and smaller.</p>

<p>The great thing about this approach is that it is nearly impossible to get a stack overflow no matter how many letters you input. To test this I ran it on every letter in the alphabet times 65 (that&rsquo;s 16,900 letters). It takes a little while to run (about 8.5 minutes) simply because it has to run through and generate all of the words in the dictionary (the dictionary i&rsquo;m using has 80368 words). This means that it is generating and checking 157 dictionary words per second (80,368words/(8.5 * 60)s = 157.56words/s). Also, because the recursive branches are pruned as soon as there are no dictionary words starting with the generated letter combination the recursion does not go too deep. For this test of 16,900 letters the live memory consumption reached a peak of only 500mb. Seeing as it only recurses to a depth where a dictionary word can still be formed the run time of the algorithm grows linearly with the number of words that can be found as apposed to an exponential relationship with the number of letters input.</p>

<p>This is my implementation:</p>

<p>//Very quick solution for generating all possible words for a given set of letters
&ndash;(BOOL)binarySearchForItem:(NSString *)item</p>

<pre><code>                  From:(NSInteger)start
                    To:(NSInteger)finish
               inArray:(NSArray *)array {
NSInteger middle = ((finish - start) / 2) + start;
NSString *middleItem = array[middle];
NSComparisonResult compare = [item compare:middleItem];
if (ABS(start - finish) &lt; 2){
    if ([item isEqualToString:array[start]]){
        return YES;
    }else if ([item isEqualToString:array[finish]]){
        return YES;
    }
    else{
        return NO;
    }
}
if (compare == NSOrderedSame){
    return YES;
}else if (compare == NSOrderedAscending){
    return [self binarySearchForItem:item From:start To:middle inArray:array];
}else{
    return [self binarySearchForItem:item From:middle To:finish inArray:array];
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>//This function uses binary search
//returns a range where all the words beginning with the letters in item can be found
//If no words begging with item are found it returns a range of (-1,-1)
&ndash;(NSRange)searchForStartingSequence:(NSString *)item</p>

<pre><code>                   inDictionary:(NSArray *)array
                          start:(NSInteger)start
                         finish:(NSInteger)finish {
NSInteger middle = ((finish - start) / 2) + start;
NSString *middleItem = array[middle];
if ([middleItem length] &gt; [item length]){
    middleItem = [middleItem substringToIndex:([item length])];
}
NSComparisonResult compare = [item compare:middleItem];
if (ABS(start - finish) &lt; 2){
    if ([item isEqualToString:array[start]] || [item isEqualToString:array[start]]){
        return NSMakeRange(start, (finish - start));
    }
    else{
        return NSMakeRange(-1, -1); //returns -1 -1 if starting sequence does not exist in dictionary
    }
}
if (compare == NSOrderedSame){
    return NSMakeRange(start, (finish - start));
}else if (compare == NSOrderedAscending){
    return [self searchForStartingSequence:item inDictionary:array start:start finish:middle];
}else{
    return [self searchForStartingSequence:item inDictionary:array start:middle finish:finish];
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>//Searches makes all permutations from lettersToAdd
//Adds each letter from letters to add as the next letter in newWord and runs recursively on each combination
//remove the letter added to newWord from lettersToAdd for that path
//Function also checks the dictionary for each newWord to see if there are any words that start with newWord
//if not the recursive branch is pruned.
//If a word is found starting with newWord the range is updated to contain the range of words in the dictionary
//containing all the words starting with newWord. This narrows down the section of the dictionary
//needed to search to determine if the word is in the dictionary.</p>
